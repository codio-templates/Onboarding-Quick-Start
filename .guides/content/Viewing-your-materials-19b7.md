You may view your course using the special student accounts Codio creates for you. There are three special test student accounts that allows you to switch between a teacher view and a student view.

1. Select your Codio course.
2. Click on the **Students** tab near the top of the page.
3. Now click the  **Add a Student** button.

### Logging in as a test student
6. As soon as you have added the test students, you are able to log in as one of the test students by pressing the **Login as** button. Please note that this is only available for the special test student accounts.

*Note the bar at the top of the screen, letting you know that you are logged in as a test student.*

### Switching back to the teacher
7. You can switch back to your main teacher account in either of these two ways:

- Press the **Switch back to teacher account** button at the top of the page. 
- Log out of the test student account.

### Pinning an Assignment
One very useful feature is to 'pin' an assignment. This allows the faculty member to pin the assignment to the top of the students' dashboards so it is easy to find.

8.  Go to the **Teach** tab

9. Click the 'Pin' icon.
