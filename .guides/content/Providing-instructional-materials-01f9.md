### Guides

Codio provides you with the tools to create your own online teaching materials or edit existing materials. These materials are called Guides and this Onboarding Guide is an example. 

Instructional content and auto-graded assessments are authored using Guides. The powerful authoring tools give you access to many features of the Codio environment. 

From your Guide you can:

- Control the layout of the IDE
- Highlight specific lines of code in the editor
- Open, close and run a file 
- Open a terminal window
- Access the Code Visualizer and pre-populate it with student code
- Create student-triggered auto-graded assessments
