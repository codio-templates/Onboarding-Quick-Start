Let's start off by creating some files. Either right click on the project name in the file tree or select **File->New File**.

This example uses Python but you can choose any language you prefer. Create the following file (just enter the file name, Codio will detect the language)

- `test.py`

You can switch between files by clicking on the tabs above the code.

Enter the following text into `test.py`

```python
print("Hello world")
```
