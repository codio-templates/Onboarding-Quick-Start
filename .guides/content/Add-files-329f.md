Let's start off by creating some files. Either right click on the project name in the file tree or select **File->New File**.

Create the following files (just enter the file name, Codio will detect the language)

- `index.html`
- `test.py`

You can switch between the files by clicking on the tabs above the code. 
![](.guides/img/tabsattop.png)
Enter the following text into `test.py`

```python
print("Hello world")
```

and this into `index.html`

```html

```

### Previewing
You can preview any html file by right-clicking the file in the tree or the code panel tab and selecting 'Preview static'. A new tab will open up and render the file. 
==You can see the box's auto-generated domain name in the url. Is this sentence necessary?==
