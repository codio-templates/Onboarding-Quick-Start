Let's start by creating several files. For each page you create that requires students to work in an IDE, you will need a file. 

1. Either right-click on the project name in the file tree or select **File->New File**.


![.guides/img/newFromFileTree](.guides/img/newFromFileTree.png)

This example uses Python but you can choose any language you prefer. 
2. Create the following files (just enter the file name, Codio will detect the language)

- `test.py`
- `test2.py`

![.guides/img/createFile](.guides/img/createFile.png) 


3. You can switch between files by clicking on the tabs above the code or in the file tree.
