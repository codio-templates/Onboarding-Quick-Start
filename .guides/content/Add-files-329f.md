Let's start off by creating some files. 

1. Either right-click on the project name in the file tree or select **File->New File**.


![.guides/img/newFromFileTree](.guides/img/newFromFileTree.png)

This example uses Python but you can choose any language you prefer. 
2. Create the following file (just enter the file name, Codio will detect the language)

- `test.py`

![.guides/img/createFile](.guides/img/createFile.png) 


3. You can switch between files by clicking on the tabs above the code. Enter the following text into `test.py`

```python
print("Hello world")
```
