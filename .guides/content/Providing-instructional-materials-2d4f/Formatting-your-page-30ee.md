### Using Markdown in Pages
---
Markdown is a lightweight markup language that you can use to add formatting elements to your Guides.

**In markdown you can edit and format:**
* Headers/Titles
* **Bold** and *Italic* 
* Numbered lists
* Code Blocks
* Indented Lists
* Callout Blocks
* Tables
* ...and many more!

On the first page of the guide we created a bulleted list by preceding each list item with the `*` key. We will now convert the bulleted list to "Callout Blocks." This formatting option is created using the "pipe" or "vertical line" key: `|` 

Use the clipboard to copy the text below. Replace the original bulleted list with this new formatting.

```

||| topic

**if statements**

|||

||| info

**if else statements**

|||

||| definition

**elif statements**

|||

```

This is what it will look like once it is rendered:

*View your rendered content by selecting **Split View** OR **Preview.***
