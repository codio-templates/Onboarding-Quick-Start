A Project/Assignment or 'Box' is the foundational structure in Codio. 

In essence, a box is a fully featured Ubuntu server with the following added features:

- A browser based Integrated Development Environment (IDE)
- Access to the command line via a terminal window
- Unix sudo level access privileges
- A code editor with syntax highlighting 
- An auto-generated domain name
- A wide range of ports



Projects/Assignments are the basis for almost everything you will do within Codio.
