A `README.md` file is created automatically when you create a project. It will open automatically every time the student accesses the project.

Click on the file name in your **File Tree**. You can switch the viewing modes using the buttons in the upper right hand corner of the window.

An alternate way to provide instructions to your students is the `README.md` file. This is a simple approach to creating instructions and the student can open and close the file as needed. 

If you don't need the `README.md` file, you can right click and delete it in the **File Tree.**
