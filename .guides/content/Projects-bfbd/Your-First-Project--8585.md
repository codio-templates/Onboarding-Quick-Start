### Stack selection

**Stacks** contain the tools (databases, languages) and configuration information needed to run your project. Codio offers you a range of commonly used configurations to get you started. For more information about customizing stacks and creating your own see the [Stacks documentation](https://docs.codio.com/develop/develop/stacks/using-stacks.html#id1).


To learn about the other available features when starting a new project, see the [Creating and importing a project](https://docs.codio.com/develop/develop/projects/create-import-project.html#create-import-project) section of the documentation.
