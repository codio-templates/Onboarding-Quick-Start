2. Click Evaluate if you would like to add it to your account.

3. Once you give your course a name, press `Create`. The rest if the details may be filled in at a later time.

4. Explore your course. Remember: everything in Codio Resources (and we mean everything)â€”from the text and code examples to auto-graded assessments, can be customized to suit your teaching context. You can even mix-and-match different resources together and with your own content!
