You may view your course using the special student accounts Codio creates for you. There are three special test student accounts that allow you to switch between a teacher view and a student view.

To view your course as a test student:

1. Select your Codio course.
2. Click on the **Students** tab under COURSE.
3. Select **Add a student**.

You will now see all three test students added to your class.

### Logging in as a test student
---
5. From the **Students** page you are able to log in and view your course as an assigned student by pressing the **Login as** button. Please note that this is only available for the special test student accounts.

Note the bar at the top of the screen, letting you know that you are logged in as a test student. When logged in as a student your experience on Codio will be restricted to what your students will have access to.

### Switching back to the teacher

6. You can switch back to your main teacher account in either of these two ways:

- Log out of the test student account.
- Press the **Switch back to teacher account** button at the top of the page.

### Pinning an Assignment
---
One very useful feature is to '**Pin**' an assignment. This allows a teacher or faculty member to pin the assignment to the top of the students' dashboards so it is easy to find.

7. With your Course selected, click the **Overview** tab.

8. Click the **Pin** icon.
