To view your course as a test student:

1. Select your Codio course.
2. Click on the **Students** tab under COURSE.
3. Select **Add a student**.

![Step 1) Open your course from the 'Courses' tab. Step 2) Select 'Students' tab. Step 3) Select 'Add a student'.](.guides/img/added-test-students.png)

4. Click on the **Add test students** button.

![Step 4) Select 'Add test students' button.](.guides/img/addTestStudents.png)


You will now see all three test students added to your class.

### Logging in as a test student

6. You can switch back to your main teacher account in either of these two ways:

### Pinning an Assignment

One very useful feature is to '**Pin**' an assignment. This allows a teacher or faculty member to pin the assignment to the top of the students' dashboards so it is easy to find.

7. With your Course selected, click the **Overview** tab.

8. Click the **Pin** icon.
