<!--Codio allows you to set up an environment for your students that will guarantee their success in completing their assignments. You provide them with all the instructional materials and tools they need in one place.

### Coding projects
At its most basic level, faculty or students can create projects for coding. There is no limit to the number of projects that you can create. Unlike a local instance where you have to worry about component conflicts, versions and many other configuration issues, being able to instantly create a server and code anything on it that is fully isolated from all other projects can be a great advantage.

### Templating and distribution
Because all projects live in the Cloud, sharing projects is easy and instant. And having the IDE always loaded means that you can dive into coding without figuring very much out.

### Tutorial authoring
If you want to use Codio to provide your instructional materials, you can use Codio Guides and have access to a full range of tutorial authoring features along with course publishing support.

### Assessment configuration
Codio has an extremely powerful set of auto-graded assessment capabilities (multiple choice and auto-graded code tests). Codio Guides provides everything you need to scaffold these.
