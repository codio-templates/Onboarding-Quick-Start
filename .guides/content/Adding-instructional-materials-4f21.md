## Assignments
In Codio, a teaching assignment is a project that has been assigned to a course. The scope of an assignment is entirely up to you. It could be a project assignment, a tutorial  built using Guides or an assessment.
 
 
### Assign a project
You can assign the project we created earlier or use a Codio supplied project. 

==Skip to the next page to see how you can use Codio supplied projects (Starter Packs). Not sure where to break this off.== 

- With the course selected, click on the Assignments tab at the top of the page. The list will be empty at this point.
- Click the blue pencil in the upper right corner to switch to edit mode.
- Now click the **+** button in the top left.
- Select **Empty Module**, type **Week 1** and click **Add Module**.
- In your newly created module click **Add Assignment** and then select **Project Based**

- Use the project you created earlier in this guide. For the **Starting Point** select **Click here** to use an existing project

- Click **Fork Project**. The name of the project you created earlier should appear in the **FORK FROM** field.

Codio takes a snapshot of your source project, ready for the students to clone when they start the Unit. Changes you make to the source project will not be reflected automatically in the student Unit.


- You can change the name of the assignment (by default it will be the name of your project with 'fork' appended) and add a description if you wish.
- Click the **Create** button and the assignment will be added to the course module in draft mode.

==in test2 was thrown into the Guide at this point so may need a step here to get back==

- Click **Publish** to make the assignment visible to your students.
