## Assignments
In Codio, a teaching assignment is a project that has been assigned to a course. The scope of an assignment is entirely up to you. It could be a project assignment, a tutorial  built using Guides or an assessment.
 
 There are two ways you can add an assignment to a class.
 
### Assign a project
The simplest and quickest thing you can do is to assign one of your projects to a class. 

- With the course selected, click on the Assignments tab at the top of the page. The list will be empty at this point.
- Now click the **+** button in the top left.
- Select **Empty Module** and create a new module.
- When created click **Add Assignment** and then select **Project Based**
- From here you can either start creating a new project or import projects in. Use the project you created earlier in this guide.

<!-- Do they need to know this now? At this point, we take a snapshot of your source project, ready for the students to clone when they start the Unit. Any changes you make to the source project will not be reflected automatically in the student Unit.-->

- Then select **Fork Project** and your project will show. If you have other projects in your **My Projects** area you can browse to select one of them.
- At this point you can set the name of the assignment (by default it will be the name of your project with 'fork' appended) and add a description if you wish.
- When ready, click the **Create** button and the assignment will be added to the course module in draft mode.
- For the assignment to be visible to your students, you need to **Publish** the assignment

### Pinning an Assignment
One very useful feature is to 'pin' the assignment. This allows the faculty member to pin the Unit to the top of the students' dashboards so it is easy to find.

If you have just assigned the new assignment then you will see your new project as the only project in the list below. To the top right of the list item is a pencil icon. Click on this and then click the 'Pin' icon.
