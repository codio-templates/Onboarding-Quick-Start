## Assignments
In Codio, a teaching assignment is a project that has been assigned to a course. The scope of an assignment is entirely up to you. It could be a project assignment, a tutorial  built using Guides, or an assessment.
 
 
### Assign a project
You can assign the project we created earlier or use a Codio supplied project. 

## Add a Module
1. With the course selected, click the **Edit** tab at the top of the page. The list will be empty at this point.

2. Click the **New Module** button.

*Codio takes a snapshot of your source project, ready for the students to clone when they start the Assignment. Changes you make to the source project will not be reflected automatically in the student assignment in your course.*

9. You can change the **name** of the assignment (by default it will be the name of your project with 'copy' appended) and add a description if you wish.

10. After selecting **Create**, the assignment will open.
