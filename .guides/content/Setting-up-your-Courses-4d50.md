Courses are where you create, organize and distribute content to your students.

Assignments (Codio boxes) can be directly created inside **Courses**, providing structure to your resources. Experimental assignments can live in **My Projects** and later be added to a course. 

A Course has the following properties:

- A grouping of students who are participating in the course.
- One or more teachers/instructors.
- Assignments and instructional materials.
- Instant access to student code and projects.
- The ability to integrate with any LTI (industry standard protocol) enabled LMS platform. Then you can use your LMS to auto-populate your course and grade data can be fed back from Codio to the LMS. The Codio Documentation has more information about [LMS Integration](https://docs.codio.com/courses/lti1_0/#lti-keys-and-urls).

### Assignment visability
Students can only see your assignments when they have been published. Published assignments can also be disabled, students can see upcoming work but not open it until you are ready.
