Courses are where you create, organize and distribute content to your students. 
Assignments (Codio boxes) can be directly created inside **Courses**, providing structure to your projects. Experimental assignments can live in **My Projects** and later be added to a course. 

### Assignment visability
You can control how your students will see their project using. There is a “DRAFT” state, for assignments you don't want your students to see. Assignments can also be disabled, students can see them but not open them until you are ready.

A Course has the following properties:

- It is a grouping of students who are participating in the course.
- It can have one or more teachers/instructors.
- You can add assignments and instructional materials.
- You can use it to instantly access student code and projects.
- You can integrate the course with any LTI (industry standard protocols) enabled LMS platform such as Canvas, D2L, Moodle, Blackboard and many others. Then you can use your LMS to auto-populate your course and grade data can be fed back from Codio to the LMS. The Codio Documentation has more information about [LMS Integration](https://codio.com/docs/classes/lti/).
