Courses are where you create, organize and distribute content to your students.

Assignments (Codio boxes) can be directly created inside **Courses**, providing structure to your projects. Experimental assignments can live in **My Projects** and later be added to a course. 

### Assignment visability
You can control when your students will see the assignments you have added. There is a **DRAFT** state for assignments you don't want your students to see. Assignments can also be disabled, students can see upcoming work but not open it until you are ready.

A Course has the following properties:

- A grouping of students who are participating in the course.
- One or more teachers/instructors.
- Assignments and instructional materials.
- Instant access to student code and projects.
- The ability to integrate with any LTI (industry standard protocol) enabled LMS platform such as Canvas, D2L, Moodle, Blackboard and many others. Then you can use your LMS to auto-populate your course and grade data can be fed back from Codio to the LMS. The Codio Documentation has more information about [LMS Integration](https://codio.com/docs/classes/lti/).
