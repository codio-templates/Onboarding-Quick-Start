### A Guide to Guides and Assessments
The **Demo Guides and Assessments** project in My Projects contains a section on the full range of text formatting capabilities within guides as well as information on creating your own assessments. If you do not see this in your My Projects list, then [click here](https://codio.com/home/starter-packs/cc68d38b-b0ea-4825-9814-46a3594c2b11/) to create this from a Codio Starter Pack. Click the **Use Pack** button to create a new project from it.
