An alternate way to provide instructions to your students is to create a README.md file. This is a simple approach to creating instructions and the student can open and close it as needed. 

The README.md file will open automatically the first time the student accesses the project.

Create a new file in your main workspace folder and name it `README.md`. You can switch between edit and view modes using the buttons within the window.
