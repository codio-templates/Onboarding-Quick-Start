An alternate way to provide instructions to your students is the `README.md` file. This is a simple approach to creating instructions and the student can open and close it as needed. 

The `README.md` file will open automatically every time the student accesses the project.

A `README.md` file is created automatically when you create a project. Click on the file name in your **Filetree**. You can switch the viewing modes using the buttons in the upper right hand corner of the window.
