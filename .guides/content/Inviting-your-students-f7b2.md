Once you have completed creating your course, you can provide your students with access to the materials by asking them to join the class.

## The Course Invite URL
The course invite url is a url that you can pass to students for joining a course and signing up if not already signed up.

- Select the course.
- Select the **Admin** tab. 
- Look for **Course Invite URL** and copy the url to the clipboard.
- You can now use this url directly (read below), send it out to people via email or put it in a web page.
