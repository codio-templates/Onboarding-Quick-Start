You can find more information about Markdown in the [Codio documention](https://codio.com/docs/content/authoring/page-edit/edit/).

To open the Guides editor go to **Tools->Guides->Edit**.

To edit content and view the rendered version at the same time, click the **Panel Layout** dropdown menu and select **Split View**.
