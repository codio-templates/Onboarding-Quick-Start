You will use Markdown to create formatted content. Markdown provides you with many of the formatting capabilities you will need without the need to dive into more complicated HTML syntax. You can find more information about Markdown in the [Codio documention](https://codio.com/docs/content/authoring/page-edit/edit/).

To open the Guides editor go to **Tools->Guides->Edit**.

To edit content and view the rendered version at the same time, click the **Panel Layout** dropdown menu and select **Split View**.

 To create a "Hello World" program follow these steps:
 * Select **File->New File**

```


This is what it will look like once it is rendered:
